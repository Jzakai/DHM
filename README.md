Collection of Resources and Findings During Our Time at ICTP

Done so far:
  Made adjustments to the main DHM code:
  Organized the program to follow a logical sequence of operations
  Added functionality to perform all operations with a single click
  Resolved issues with negative/positive cells in phase computation
  Enabled batch processing of multiple images
  Fixed ROI selection – now works correctly from the first click
  Corrected the thickness functions – each function now opens in a separate, independent window

To do:
  Improve the noise reduction functionality using Artificial Intelligence
  Train a machine learning model for remote, label-free, automated point-of-care disease diagnosis.
  Use features extracted from DHM to train ML algorithms for detecting diseases such as malaria and sickle cell anemia.
